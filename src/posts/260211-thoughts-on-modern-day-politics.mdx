if you're reading this and it's not finished, it's because i'm still writing it. this one's gonne be foggin long

it's not done!

anyways

this whole post boils down to one thing. you have the **right** to believe whatever the hell you want. i knew a fella who thought loki and thor were real gods. i get mythology or whatever, but i *personally* don't subscribe to it. whatever. anyways, you have the right to believe it, but is it right? is it moral? will you be on the right side of history? trick question. there is no right side of history. there is wrong, and there is right. go figure. real first grade shit, but people forget how to be nice and decent. hatred, greed, and other very human things make us this way.

# i. people being emboldened

today's average ai *passes-for-news-in-some-circles* slop consumer is an idiot. both sides. god, i hate facebook with a *BURNING* passion. why do you guys get to be the leaders in the tech world? see [the monstrous list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_content_management_controversies) of content management controversies, it is just really the wild west. facebook "cares" but it seems like they don't care. i am of the school of thought that if i don't like it, i just won't use it.

but really, who doesn't use it? this is the worst part of this whole thing is that everyone has it, and it has become the defacto place to find anyone. "oh are they on facebook?" "oh, have you checked marketplace?" it's all facebook all the way down. that's why it's so fuckin' hard to see people you've known (possibly for all of your life) spew hateful (or even just agressive) things. you have a right to an opinion, and you have a right to defend it, but at very least, be nice >:|

it's also hard to see people that you know and trust and love sharing just... blatantly incorrect things. like, i'm not talking about a matter of opinions here. you know what they say about opinions... rather, incontrovertible facts??? the face book is not the source of facts, and if you think it is, you're an idiot. i'm really being too harsh on facebook (not) because they aren't the only ones, but at the same time, my grandma doesn't have threads or twitter or [other less prominent social media site], but she does have facebook.

this leads me to the greatest internet cliché i can think of

# ii. hiding behind a screen

have you ever seen someone post something online that you know for a fact they wouldn't say to your face? the amount of times i have seen this in the past week (been looking at facebook a bit...) is insane.

*it is also worth mentioning that within the past few weeks, the big "files" were released (donal drump supporters out the woodwork here (as if they were still in the woodwork)), as well as the superbowl happened ("why would they put a puerto rican on national tv???")... puerto rico is a territory, folx!*

but fuck! none of this is an excuse to be fuckin rood online.

# iii. the line keeps moving - the more extreme it gets, the more people are horrified at where the line is drawn

you can bet your bottom dollar on who your bumpkin ass neighbor is voting for. go fuckin figure! but as much as you want to make fun of this neighbor, they are a person and have a line that they have drawn for personal reasons. it may be experience, parroting, or just general common sense (subject-to-individual). but either way, everyone has a line that they draw. they draw it at different spots. i'd like to assume that everyone has *around* the same baseline, but who knows. [nobody knows](https://open.spotify.com/track/1nFBrlKxyyZukoDfxBTEbn?si=5287ed93228642cd). [that's the way it goes](https://open.spotify.com/track/2MAjUnC4wNRcNTPUqoONvh?si=8eade67398094e75). really, it's all [whatever gets you thru the night](https://open.spotify.com/track/49nBXQzYNyjoBmUda3ezMf?si=3d098a8481a04421). [it don't come easy](https://open.spotify.com/track/4RFqi5JQduiSlRZCVlUDGH?si=dbb15de6246b4ab1) drawing a line, but everyone's got to have one. the absolutely CRAZY thing is seeing someone's line shift in real time. it's nobody's fault, you're allowed to believe in whatever cause (and believe it or not, i do believe that there exists a class of person, an "innocent optimist", if even not referred to as gullible or ditzy). this is your prerogative, and you're allowed to it. but at a certain point, everyone's lines suddenly shift. if it crosses your line and you have a grand realization, that's great!

in the case of everyone else (the ones who shift their line each time), what the actual fuck is wrong with you? that's harsh. at the same time, what the fuck is wrong with you? anyways, don't defend stupid shit. it's that simple. did a politician say something that you believed that turned out to be not the truth? did the same thing happen like... i don't know... hundreds of times before? quit moving your fucking line and have a spine you mongrel!

# iv. love your neighbor, but keep a keen eye

in the *strange case of bent over buddy, and carnival jack*, there exists a neighbor that you know (and possibly love! eek!) that has a secret that you don't know. not to quote point ii or anything, but that screen makes them bolder than a fuggin new york times headline. CONGRATS! YOUR NEIGHBOR SAID SOME UNDEFENDABLE SHIT ON FACEBOOK! anyways, not cool, but i digress. you never know what your cool ass neighbor is hiding or saying behind closed doors. this whole section 4 is just satire really, but it is also real. scary that someone that you know to have great morals in general, easy-going, day to day life can have just absolutely abhorrent takes on other things.

it could be your grandma for all you know!

# v. wishful thinking (and how to know when to quit)
# vi. hypocrisy (and not just from the people you don't like)

you are guilty. i am guilty. everyone, even the people that try to have a super wide and unbiased view of situations still, by nature, have their own narrative that they (often) know is biased. "but why would someone disagree with what i'm saying", i'm hearing you ask, dear reader. because circumstance. because mercury's in gatorade. people grow up in shitty situations. people have different [parr](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Rainbow_lorikeet_%28Trichoglossus_moluccanus_moluccanus%29_Sydney.jpg/500px-Rainbow_lorikeet_%28Trichoglossus_moluccanus_moluccanus%29_Sydney.jpg)ents than you.

you are guilty of comparing your worldview to others', at very least. while not inherintly a bad thing to be guilty of, you're *not* [not guilty](https://open.spotify.com/track/6yBJoRzDcP8WwqF38l5aTn?si=1a3558af11e8439f). double negatives are good for the soul. people draw the line (iii reference!) at different places, and ultimately, that's your choice. but, whether you like it or not, you possess a bias.

# vii. you are being lied to, fed misinformation, and you STILL take it at face value

let's get down to the brass tacks! you've got your bias, but now you have to decide what to do with it. do you let your bias decide what to do with the **facts** that your eyes are seeing, or do you believe the lies? what happened to renee good? was alex pretti's phone a gun? how about that footage of alex pretti that was shared of him being less than a peaceful protester? who cares the source? who cares where it came from? is it real? the news is showing me these things, and what am i to believe? where does my bias come into this.

what are the facts? i'm not going to tell you what i think, or for that matter, the facts that we know. we saw it on national tv. see what you come up with. consider it an exercise in critical thinking. this isn't a call to see it my way, whatever that may be (???), but rather an exercise in looking at what your eyes are telling you about the situation, and maybe a little bit of context (maybe 30 seconds more of video) may help.

did the highest office in this nation lie to you? how about the department that rhymes with bomeland becurity? did they lie to you? to your face?

# viii. social media (ii part ii)

oooooooohhhh that's just slopppy. don't bring your shite belief into this, you hag. you're entitled to it, but let's be real. that shit is archaic. get with the progress, and get with the program, or get the FUCK out!!!!!

wow, that felt bad to get off my chest. it should feel the other way around, but i added you on this horrid social (media) experiment, because i know you and i thought you were decent. that sucks. oh well. guess i should have known you would say some horrid shit online??? 🤷‍♂️

whatever dude. you shouldn't have access to the internet /rant

# ix. social policy and when to speak

it's really nobody's fuckin business what you do in your own life. i'm not saying we should throw out the manual and be an anarchist state, but you should be able to do what the hell you want with your own life. it's ironic to me that conservatives seem to live in the realm of "freedom, flags, and eagles", except when it comes down to "i don't like your freedom", or "your freedom should look the same as my freedom"

## straight-to-the-point examples (not a complete list)
follow closely here, as these are hard for some people to understand

* if you want to have an abortion
  * the government should **NOT** be able to tell you that you can't.
* if you want to explore your sexuality or have [any kind of] partner
  * the government should **NOT** be able to tell you who that partner can and can not be.

* more to come

just in case you didn't get that, *you (as in you) should not have any say in anyone's personal lives*. it's not your life, and it's not your fuckin business.

# x. it's okay to disagree

it's okay to have respectful dialog, and it's what modern democracy was built on. you're allowed to have an opinion (even if it's shit!) and i'm allowed to respectfully tell you you're wrong, or praise your ideas.

# xi. when it becomes not okay

don't call people names 

# xii. educate yourself (and don't be a parrot!)

social media hatred train part 3 (//TODO:)

# xiii. how to tell when someone's lying
# xiv. opinion =/= fact, and sometimes sharing is not, in fact, caring
# xv. why now (access to information and opinions, bias) and how opinions are circulated far and wide
# xvi. if it feels wrong, it probably is
# xvii. history repeating itself
# xviii. the rise of ai (and its horrid consequences)
# xix. when (to) and not (to) trust the government (vaccines and education vs stupid shit)
# xx. being better (we are all guilty)
