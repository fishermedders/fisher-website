*edit 2/3/26*: i wrote this after a long night out, so if it reads like this, that's why 🤪

they never tell you just how quick you can lose someone. i had a close friend of mine lose his father to pancreatic cancer just weeks after his diagnosis. it is a fucking gut punch. i can not imagine this scenario and i’d imagine i’d find myself saying something like

> this is literally the worst case scenario

and it would be true! that sucks the **big** one.

i am lucky. i am lucky beyond what anyone would think they would be. i have not suffered any form of direct loss (of life). excluding things like grands passing (which also hurts, go figure), i have not suffered any real loss in this way.

the thing that hurts is when you lose someone that is still alive. they still think of you, and you them. you place your trust in someone and suddenly, they are gone from your life. oftentimes it feels like they are gone without a trace! not to totally stroke my own ego, but i think i’ve got a decent head on my shoulders, but even then i sometimes feel crazy! i know that these people still exist, and oftentimes i know where they are and what they are doing. but it still hurts.

when someone dies, you don’t worry about them, they don’t know that they are dead, or that you are still living. you are the one who has to carry the weight of this passing. you are the one who still carries the memory. they couldn’t care less. maybe in life they would, but now they are simply incapable of caring.

that is why it is so effin hard when you lose someone to a non-death-causing-form-of-loss (ndcfol). i have made this up. they have moved on and hopefully found the peace that they needed (or didn’t know that they needed)

## she doesn’t love you anymore
*just one example*

go on. place your trust in someone that you love. give them the key to the vault that nobody knows exists. let them in on things you wouldn’t dare tell the best of friends. and then watch as this trust is eroded in front of you in realtime. to quote dean martin, aint that a kick in the balls…

really, in this situation, i’d imagine it goes this one way every time. this is just a theory, but i think it’s a good one (only the lord knows, really)—i think that there is always a part of this person that is attached to these memories and the good times you shared. time, erosion of relationships, and downright betrayal can not stop you from feeling these feelings. you may push them deep down, far inside the parts that never see the light of day, but at the end of that day, they are still there.

a very real possibility is that it could be your fault, but it takes two to tango. this is why it stings. there is a line here, obviously murder > being chronically late & forgetting. still, it hurts. the time was spent, the love was had, and for a brief moment you lived in the most glorious sunshine you could imagine.

## you just can’t be friends anymore
*just another example*

sometimes things will happen that are out of your control. something will happen that shakes your world and turns it upside down. congratulations, you are now falling. on the bright side, you do have the benefit of hindsight, congratulations, you are now falling in slow motion. how miserable.

i can not control people’s actions. it is a mystery to me why things happen, and moreover it is a mystery how it always, without fail, happens to be some sort of coincidental event. oh some great life thing just happened? congratulations, this really shit thing will now happen and affect everyone around you. maybe i am looking too much into things, but my advanced primate brain will always remind me how often ‘coincidental’ things happen. i dont make the rules, i just observe and break them (depending on my mood)

i have confided in you and loved you as a great friend of mine, but it’s the end of the line. there are no more stops and it hurts because living in bliss and ignorance and passing all the stops along the way was a great joy. i hate it because it’s much of the same, the memories will always tether you to a different mindset.

it no longer serves me to continue this friendship (to put it into formal terms)

## yeah

life is too short to not speak your mind, honestly & truthfully. i will die one day, and if not 6 feet under, perhaps ashes in a river. either way i’ll contribute to the greater energy and substance that makes life to repeat this same old cycle old as time. that being said

a & j — thanks for all the good times along the way
