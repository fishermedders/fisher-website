*The stars as seen from Northern Glynn County, 9/24/25*

I was surprised to see how incredible a long exposure photo taken on an iPhone could be.

While driving last night with the top down, I caught two (!!) shooting stars on my ride home. I won’t tell you what I wished for, you’ll just have to guess. Guess twice, I made a couple.

I think this one is more akin to a journal post than anything else, as I am aiming to write at least *something* every day. Oftentimes, the things that I write don’t make it to print because they are either sensitive topics or things that I just don’t want to say to someone yet.

We will see what I end up doing. I’ve got a list of topics to choose from, as well as writing exercises in general. Stay tuned for sometimes boring, sometimes introspective posts.
