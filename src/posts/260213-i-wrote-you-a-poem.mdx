so uh

hey

i wrote you a poem if u wanna see it

no

i don't have the original scrap of paper

it blew out of the car when i was jammin' with the windows down. i'm sorry. i littered. i have done marsh and river cleanups before, so i feel like i have offset my litter tho so whatever.

anyways

here goes

> you ask me why  
> why  
> why must the sun rise  
> don't you know it rises for you  
> oh lover, don't you know  
> it rises for you?  
>  
> you lie in morning's warm haze  
> lie  
> lie while it shines for you  
> & all of your ways  
> oh lover it shines for you  
> & all your ways  
>  
> oh lover you must know  
> what reason other would  
> it have to grace our eyes  
> to touch our lives  
> oh lover you too must know  
>  
> i have no answer why  
> why  
> why the sun must rise  
> all i can reason  
> for all of her seasons  
> oh lover it rises for you  

i'd tell you who it's about, but it would ruin the big surprise!
