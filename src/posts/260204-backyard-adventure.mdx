if you've never heard the term "backyard adventure", you're missing out. it is pretty much summed up by reading the term. it's an adventure in your backyard. of course, this is the "greater" backyard, being the space around you, or convenient to you. this can really be anything, getting a good walk in, camping close to home, or just exploring. make yourself uncomfortable and get out there an see something. experience something.

## i have been inspired.

youtube is filled with content you never knew you'd want or need. it's full of people who have a passion for what they are doing, and endless ideas. i have been watching a load of videos recently that all fall under the category of "backyard adventure". two channels that i have been thoroughly enjoying have been [beau miles](https://www.youtube.com/beaumiles) and [geowizard](https://www.youtube.com/geowizard). an australian youtuber, educator, author, and outdoorsman, and a british youtuber and adventurer, respectively. without fail, all of the videos these guys make are just so enjoyable.

### beau miles

beau miles' videos always have such great storytelling. he will come up with a concept, and just make it. i am not naïve enough to think that there isn't an enormous amount of planning and legwork to make each video, but the point he gets across every video (without fail, and often without even saying it) is that anyone can have a backyard adventure.

for example, one of the best videos of his that i think explains this very well is his video entitled ["Running a different kind of marathon: A Mile an Hour"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvT5XS7j-Dc). it is exactly as it sounds. he runs a loop around his block (which is around a mile), and completes some kind of task on his land in that time. repair a chair? done. next mile. craft a paddle? done. next mile. cook a soup for dinner? done. next mile. this is such a novel idea for anyone, because this is a super low barrier to entry, and on top of that, he just tells a great story while doing it.

another thing i admire about beau is his ability to make something out of self-categorized "junk". look at his playlist ["Making things from junk (Series)"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXoBa_nJj5lUSpMmZ3ERbFp7mG4Gqg-f2). it is full of him just taking things he finds and has collected over the years and making something new and useful out of them. two of his videos come to mind, and probably are my favorites of the junk series. the first is ["I went on TV and gave away gifts made from junk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdgNcoVzl2o&list=PLXoBa_nJj5lUSpMmZ3ERbFp7mG4Gqg-f2&index=6&pp=iAQB), in which beau builds an adirondack chair and a paddle out of pallets he finds in the city he's in and takes them on the news to show how this stuff is really easy to do if you put your mind to it. the barrier to entry is low and any "junk" can still be useful. the second is ["Drinking wine found on the side of the road"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDBOtFgaYhQ&list=PLXoBa_nJj5lUSpMmZ3ERbFp7mG4Gqg-f2&index=3&pp=iAQB). this sounds absolutely nuts but the bottle was sealed 🤷‍♂️. he sits in his paddock and talks about life. it's a great 15 minutes to spend, and really shows the spirit he's trying to convey.

### geowizard

geowizard, aka tom davies, is newer to me, but i have been quickly churning through his videos. apparently, he is most known, and named, for his association with geoguessr. i haven't seen any of those videos, but i'm sure they are entertaining as well. tom and beau's videos are much in the same spirit, and very entertaining. i watched the whole series of ["Straight Line Misson Across England"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO0XbbL_gBE&list=PL_japiE6QKWrN8t0-oUKOoMGxkcj76bcN), in which he, as the title suggests, walks across england in a straight line at the shortest (and most doable) span across. it was very amusing watching him run his way through farmers' fields attempting to not be seen by the farmers (as they are private property... fuck it!) i also really enjoyed his ["How NOT to travel America"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_japiE6QKWrCfn7NFL86bRSWez5DTDWt) series along with greg davies-jones. it was a whirlwind of these two brits finding their way from boston to miami in much unconventional (but very adventurous) means. when they were leaving charleston to head to savannah, they realized a hurricane (ian) was coming, and decided to skip savannah and drive through the night to get some road under their belt to try and beat the hurricane. in one shot once it's night, they have entered georgia, and have driven a good while and there is a shot that i think is the brunswick pulp and paper mill, as they shortly enter florida after this (the brunswick pulp and paper mill is only some 30 miles from the ga-fl line.)

i realize all of those videos are more "grand" adventures than backyard adventures, but it still embodies the same kind of energy and feel, even if more high risk. one that i did think was more akin to a "backyard adventure" was ["I attempted to walk across Greater London without using a single road"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4476uSeTsg8&t=955s&pp=ygUdY3Jvc3NpbmcgbG9uZG9uIHdpdGggbm8gcm9hZHM%3D). this is realistically done for anyone, and is just a fun challenge if you're nutty enough. i love videos like this because it is just a fun challenge with arbitrary rules set, and what a good way to spend some time and test your will. i imagine that the phrase "how did i get here" was thought several times throughout that adventure.

## my recent outing

i recently walked from goulds inlet all the way to the village on saint simons island, had breakfast, and then walked all the way around the other side of the marsh towards the east beach causeway, and down through the neighborhood next to gould's inlet. while not particularly "exciting" in an adventure way, it allowed me to slow down and take some time to see places that i'm usually speeding through. it gave me a lot of time to think on a cool morning, and was a great excuse to have a long beach on the walk. i also tried palmer's village cafe for the first time ever, and i've got to say, those biscuits and gravy were criminally good. 10/10.

## why is the status on this post marked "in-progress"?

i intend to update this post with more "backyard adventures" that i find myself in as time goes by. i don't really know how often i will update this, but hopefully as i remember, i will.
