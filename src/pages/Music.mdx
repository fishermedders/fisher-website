# music
i like a lot of music. music is one of those funny things where it is so engrained in you, and it is everywhere, but simultaneously you feel the tremendous weight that there is just so much music that you will never hear (scary!)

*relevant!*

below is a list of my favorite songs, albums, etc, in no particular order

# the list
i lied. it is kind of in an order, but it must start at the beginning

## the beatles
god i have always loved the beatles. this is a hot take, but they are genuinely one of the most inspiring bands i've ever listened to. above all, this is a starting point to the list, and the beatles remind me of my childhood. i got my first mp3 player from my aunt (it was a [creative zen v plus in black and green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZEN_V)), and i loved it. i have a fond childhood memory of standing in the kitchen of my childhood home in the kitchen, waiting to go get pizza, and listening to eleanor rigby on my little dinky brick where the beatles lived. it must have been winter, because the sun had set, and the dark winter night was such a contrast to this song which was very new to me at the time.
