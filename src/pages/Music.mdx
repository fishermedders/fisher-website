# music
i like a lot of music. music is one of those funny things where it is so engrained in you, and it is everywhere, but simultaneously you feel the tremendous weight that there is just so much music that you will never hear (scary!)

![a meme i quite like](https://preview.redd.it/all-the-music-v0-8j26txoscdf91.png?auto=webp&s=c129b2ef4a1606dacae3bb02c5d5dd42c927659f)
*relevant!*

this page is a work in progress. i have scaffolded it with a bunch of formative artists, as well as folks who keep on giving. below is a list of my favorite songs, albums, etc, in no particular order

## the list
i lied. it is kind of in an order, but it must start at the beginning

## the beatles
god i have always loved the beatles. this is a hot take, but they are genuinely one of the most inspiring bands i've ever listened to. above all, this is a starting point to the list, and the beatles remind me of my childhood. i got my first mp3 player from my aunt (it was a [creative zen v plus in black and green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZEN_V)), and i loved it. i have a fond childhood memory of standing in the kitchen of my childhood home in the kitchen, waiting to go get pizza, and listening to eleanor rigby on my little dinky brick where the beatles lived. it must have been winter, because the sun had set, and the dark winter night was such a contrast to this song which was very new to me at the time.

yeah yeah, we get it, one of the bigest bands of all time is one of your favorites. big whoop. you know, they are a big inspiration in a lot of ways, namely because they were pioneers in studio techniques, mixing and melding generes, and just being your authentic self in music. obviously, they were at the forefront in music, so there was a façade, but listen to john lennon talk about "help" in interviews, or paul mccartney the story of "hey jude".

## george harrison

george harrison was my first real deep dive. (really second, but i have made my stance on the beatles **very** clear)

if you take someone who was overworked, overliked, overexposed, and undersold and squeezed him into a box that not only his audience, but his bandmates and the suits wanted him to be in, the box explodes and you get george harrison. from spirituality to words of wisdom, to downright quirk, and pirate covers of his biggest songs, he really is one of my favorites. i have never spent more time looking into an artist that fascinated me than him and i really think he's a good time.
