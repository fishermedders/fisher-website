# fisher
my name is fisher medders, and this is my corner of the internet.

i am 25 years old (subject to change), from georgia, and i am a taurus (go figure, amirite)

i like to play the guitar, and [sometimes the fool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vwIRhx2hcY). i love a good guinness, even though she often doesn't love me back, and the occasional long beach on the walk

i also do hobbyist programming (this website was written by a human (me)), and while i'm not super great at finding the cut-and-dry most efficient way of doing things, i am content with understanding logic and just *trying*
