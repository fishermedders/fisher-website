## pluribus

i love this show. i saw a clip of it on youtube, and i had to see it. it came out at the end of 2025 and is just such a brilliant take on the whole "apocolypse" genre. the first episode is totally chilling. not only is there just the perfect amount of exposition on the whole <Spoiler>this thing came from space, and we don't know what it is, but they are giving us some sort of genetic code</Spoiler>, but it just totally seems like something that the people of humanity would do. sure, let's just <Spoiler>take this message from space that looks awfully like a genetic sequence and just... make it?</Spoiler>. the nature of the show makes me think of the individual and how much it matters that we are all different, and how those differences make a perfect tapestry where creativity happens, new ideas are formed, and love can happen. i just kept thinking about art the whole time. like art as a whole. the show actually mentions this (not exactly in the context of individuality), but it is a subtle nudge to make you think about the whole <Spoiler>the individual is the only one who can make art, but if everyone knows the same things, and effectively are the same entity, it is no longer special. if one of the "others" as they are known made some art, it would not be special.</Spoiler>

the characters in this show are very likeable and i think that if i was carol (the main character) i would act the same way. i mean, come on <Spoiler>all of humanity has been brainwashed to be the one in the same. they all know the same thing and everyone on earth all know the same things right as they happen. well, except for the 11.</Spoiler> i would, too, be pissed off that my world has been turned upside down.

my favorite character was the most determined, a paraguayan self-storage owner named manousos oviedo. he had a whole episode telling his story where he <Spoiler>travelled from paraguay to albuquerque, through all of the countries and states inbetween, just acting pissed at all of the "others". he learns english from a set of cassettes and listens to them all while driving his mg midget one hell of a long way, until he reaches a patch of the amazon that is just too much to cross, and he does it anyways</Spoiler> i loved his episode, and the words


<Spoiler>my name is manousos oviedo. i am not one of them. i wish to save the world</Spoiler>   
<Spoiler>my name is manousos oviedo. i am not one of them. i wish to save the world</Spoiler>  
<Spoiler>my name is manousos oviedo. i am not one of them. i wish to save the world</Spoiler>  
<Spoiler>my name is manousos oviedo. i am not one of them. i wish to save the world</Spoiler>  
<Spoiler>my name is manousos oviedo. i am not one of them. i wish to save the world</Spoiler>  


are burned into my head. i saw a review of that episode as it came out that said 'i would die for manousos oviedo'. nuff said

i watched the last episode of the first season without knowing it was the last episode and i was pissed and wanted more. :( i can not wait until the next season.
