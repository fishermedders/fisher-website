# movies

this is simply a list of my favorite movies, as well as ones that i've just... *seen*. "but fisher!", i hear you say, "that's what letterboxd is for!", to which i would say "no"

it's not that i think i'm too good for letterboxd, but i think this way is much more fun 🤷‍♂️

*aaaalso*, this is obviously not a complete list of all of the movies i've ever seen, and i don't classify myself a film buff. we'll see if i get around to entering the backlog of movies i've seen, but ideally i think that i'd go back and watch them again first.

this was a thriller that was based on the premise of you expecting one thing based on what has been presented and then being totally bait and switched. there was, however, a point in the movie where the cat was coming out of the bag, and then the rest of the plot was obvious. also, the exposition was the slowest part of the movie. saw this on a date and was decently enjoyable. 6/10 maybe would watch again.
